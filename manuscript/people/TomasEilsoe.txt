**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**


My parents firmly believed that without intrinsic motivation it was counterproductive to study. Despite of their futile attempts to generate motivation for the topics in school, I found school mostly boring. My teachers told me at every school/home conversation that my grades were influenced by my lack of doing homework, but my parents kept cool and held onto their belief.

I don’t think I was considered a nerd by my classmates, but I was almost always passionate, at nerd level, about something outside of school. Since it was not as easy to get information back then, I was forced to learn about my passions in a very experimenting way. I learned about things such as kite aerodynamics by iteratively building mental/physical models and experimenting with them to improve the kite's stability and maneuverability. Same thing with electronics, engines, guitar and many other topics. When I was 12, my uncle spotted my interest in computers and gave me ZX81 computer for my 12 year birthday. I taught myself to code by typing programs of from magazines, then changing and experimenting with them. The first program I coded entirely myself, helped my father keep track of he’s angora rabbits family tree. Later I taught myself to code assembler on Commodore 64 in the same way … and so on. 

Much of the time learning was a mildly frustrating experience. Afterall it was mostly experimenting to find that what I thought would work - didn’t work. I found though, that the more frustrating it had been, the more rewarding it became to finally succeed. It was hard work, but always rooted in intrinsic motivation to solve some problem I cared about - it had a purpose so I persevered.

As a young adult I applied to become a fighter pilot in the Danish Air Force. I ended up passing all the tests. After 6 years of selection process, leadership and flying education, I flew F-16’s operationally for six additional years. I had achieved my ultimate dream and goal.

I’m convinced that many of my colleagues who dropped out were much smarter and could have become better leaders and pilots then I. But one thing I noticed was, that most of the guys who dropped out, were not quite as eager to keep experimenting and persevere when they struggled. Which we all did.

I think my parents somewhat extreme attitude towards learning, as a second order effect, gave me a habit pattern and a strong belief that I can accomplish the things i'm passionate about. That all the hard work matters, and that it will be worth it in the end.


**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I’m currently enjoy working as a freelance agile coach, but I’m an entrepreneur by heart. I’ve been involved in multiple startups and i’m constantly tempted to start another. It’s a lot of fun, but hard work too. I’m sure I would be trying to change the world in some small startup somewhere. The latest startup I considered was not directly IT related. I was about applying a subscription model to kids toys, which could work since kids are done with their toys long before the toy wear out. If not a startup, i’d definitely be in a place where things needs change.



**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

I think my biggest personal challenge is the flipside of one of my strength - an ability and need to focus, work hard and persevere for things i’m passionate about. There are unfortunately multiple bad things on the flipside of that coin :-(
First of all focus means down prioritizing other things. I love spending time with my family, but when i’m in the “zone” for too long my brain loses track of time and anything outside the zone. Fortunately I have a great wife who can give me the space I need, but also knows me better than I do myself. She helps create a healthy balancing loop.
Also - I suffer pathetically when doing things like mowing the lawn, cleaning the car or doing the taxes. I'm still trying to learn how to enjoy that, or just not hate it as much. 


**What drives you?**

I guess i’m driven by many things. Fortunately for most of the time I find myself in the top of Maslow's pyramid. Actually I think Maslow made a mistake building that pyramid. There should be one level above self actualization. “Altruistisk needs” would be a good name for it. Most of the time i’m up there - driven by making some positive change in the world.

At the moment I’m really passionate about scaling agile and making work in organisations more efficient - especially product development. 


**What is your biggest achievement?**

One of my biggest achievement was a startup I cofounded. I quit my software project manager job, to build a product to train fighter pilots and test air defence systems. I founded the Startup with my best friend and we set out to build and sell simulators to Air Forces around the world in competition with major defence firms. The reason I consider it a significant achievement, is that we knew that the typical time from customer interest to contract/cash in the defence industry is about 6 years. We had runway for just 1 year. We knew we needed to do things differently - thinking agile in the whole business stack. It was really tough, we failed a lot and totally underestimated the challenges. We ended up succeeding against all odds though and even won competitions using agile contracts, which was unheard of in government procurement at that time. The company is still active, although it’s not my primary focus currently.

**What is the last book you have read?**

“The Lean Machine” by Dantar P. Oosterwal, about how Harley Davidson drove growth and profitability by implementing Lean product development.	

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**


I think you should ask: “Which book made the most impact on you and in what way did it influence you ?“

My answer would be Peter M. Senge “The fifth discipline”. I read it a long time ago, but I still remember its impact. I guess I always intuitively felt that the interrelatedness of things often were more important than the individual things themselves. I didn’t feel I had the tools to think about it in a clever way though. This book provided the foundation for that and I still remember the profound impact the book made on how I now approach problems, view organisations, people and the world. It gave me a coherent set of ideas on how to think about interrelated things and the flawed thinking processes I share with most other homosabiens.


**If you could get one wish granted about our software industry what would you wish for?**

I think the biggest problem in IT is actually not isolated to the IT industry, but influence any industry with knowledge workers. I see that too many people are not motivated by passion and purpose in their daily work. This problem might seem as an ethical luxury problem at first, but I think it's the biggest problem from a business results perspective too.

In the military you have a KPI for it - morale it’s called. The military have known for long that morale correlate strongly to an organization's ability to achieve mission objectives. According to a 2014 Deloitte research paper, 78% of business leaders also found improving employee engagement both urgent and important. Despite these facts, and “Be passionate” listed as an official company value or displayed on wall posters in office spaces, I see companies struggle achieving it. Managers commit the organisation to it and try to hire people who have it, but in reality most don’t know what to do to actually get it.

In the military I experienced first hand how humans are willing to sacrifice their own interests, for a “company”, and how easy and natural it can be, to risk your own life for the same. Well actually and importantly, not for the company, but for the other people in the company. For the group you belong to, whom you know would also risk their lives for you when you need it. Surprisingly to some, the military consistently achieve this level of commitment, in a rapid, structured and inexpensive way. I think Simon Sinek, who has done one of the most popular ted talks of all time, describe very well how to lead, influence and build companies to achieve this level of commitment in business. I recommend a search on youtube if you are not familiar with him. He portrays very accurate the leadership I experienced and strived to conduct myself as a an officer in the Air Force. 

What needs to change is how everyone, especially the leaders, in a company think and act to protect the interests of the company. To achieve that, some of our mental models needs a reboot. That's the challenge.

Fortunately it seems like the wave of change is rolling, but my wish is that we find a way to accelerate and rapidly upgrade our mental models, so that business results are delivered through purpose and passion. Im convinced the outcome will be a profound positive change for workers, companies and their customers. More enterprise innovation, aggressive adaptability and bottom line growth. It’s hard to visualise how much human time & energy is currently wasted trying to survive or fighting the internal workings of the enterprise, instead of fighting for it.
