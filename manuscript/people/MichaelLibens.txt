**What is something people usually don't know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

Having been an avid BMX racer and Breakdancer the daredevil approach started early, and has stuck during my professional life.	

In addition having been raised to have a strong focus on keeping time and always make an effort to reach results sticks with me.	



**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**


Most likely either a Danish Teacher  - what I believed until late in Gymnasium - or an Export Engineer - which I dropped out from having learned to program my PC.


**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

I’m very transparent - which brings great energy when I’m excited, but is a challenge if I’m annoyed or angry with a situation.



**What drives you?**

Delivering business optimization through IT in a large scale.
Working in great teams with cool people achieving common goals.
Mentoring others to become better at managing themselves, teams and programs.




**What is your biggest achievement?**


Raising a fantastic strong, independent, clever and empathic daughter together with my wife, and being a reasonably good bonus-dad for 2 other wonderful young persons.




**What is the last book you have read?**



“The Phoenix Project” (Professionally) and “The best things for me and my friends” (Free Time)	


**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

Q : Who or What is your biggest inspiration ? A : People who stand calm in times of turmoil, and are willing to sacrifice all for liberty and democracy. 


**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**


I’m still finding my way into this world, having worked the last 2 years with introducing SAFe, Scrum and Kanban for 10+ agile teams. I’d like to see forums with focus on the ways and issues is scaling agile - and we have launched a linkedin group for SAFe and LeSS interested persons on LinkedIn. “SAFe & LeSS Community Danmark”
