**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

Growing up as an only child, I’ve taught myself to become a self-starter in order to have something to do, as I didn’t have siblings to play with, and friends weren’t always available. So, I enjoy starting different things up and doing “extra-curricular” things to keep myself engaged and entertained with meaningful projects where I learn new and very different things. For example, while studying Software Engineering, I taught myself to perform improvisational rapping, as I wanted to learn something totally different from my field of study.


**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I would’ve become the greatest rapper in Denmark.

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

Being patient is something I struggle with, but I think I’m getting better at it as I get older and the more children I have. It’s a good thing for me because it keeps me going and fuels my drive.

**What drives you?**

The thought of making a difference and improving people’s (work) lives.

**What is your biggest achievement?**

Scoring my wife ;-)

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

Why do you work in the agile space? 
Because it includes so many aspects from so many professional fields that it’s both fascinating and challenging. In the end, agile is all about understanding and motivating people to improve, and learning how to do that is very interesting to me.

**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**

As agile has grown out of IT, and more and more practitioners join the Danish agile community, I’d like it to be more open about when agile transformations go wrong and the lessons learned when organizations fail on their continued agile journeys. I believe that the biggest learnings occur when mistakes are made, and I’d love for our community to get better at articulating failures, so we can all learn from each other’s mistakes. With Comic Agilé, we’ve shown one way of doing that, but it can essentially be in any form, as long as we talk about it and learn from it.

**What are you most proud of in your work?**

Having used humor to provoke thousands of people to reflect on and improve their agile practices.

**Whom do you think we should ask next?**
