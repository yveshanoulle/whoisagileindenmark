**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

I used to be insanely scared of heights. Overcoming that through lots of exposure has proven to me that I get to decide who I want to become not my environment or whatever traits I am born with.	 


**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

Probably some kind of consultant in another field trying to help companies work more effectively. I wonder if being at the wrong place at the wrong time could have made me a consultant working with stage gate models - I hope I would have had enough brain to see through the scam but who knows? - humans are pretty easy to brainwash….

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**
Making small-talk in a room full of people I do not know. Good, because it reminds me that there are always things you can learn and get better at - even if practising it is extremely uncomfortable.	


|  |



**What drives you?**

Staying at the frontier of process-improvement trying out new concepts and adapting them to organizations and contexts. Making it more engaging and fun for people to go to work.

**What is your biggest achievement?**

Besides my two sons and a girlfriend that miraculously puts up with me - getting to a point in my life where I am doing what I want, at the levels that I hoped, with the freedom to decide for myself and with enough spare time to enjoy more than just my work and travel the world with my family.   




**What is the last book you have read?**

Toyota Kata Culture: Building Organizational Capability and Mindset through Kata Coaching. Mike Rother

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

Question. Why are so many Agile Coaches full of themselves?
Answer: Because they think they stumbled on the holy grail and the rest of the world is soooooooooo far behind.
Sadly we will wake up one day to realize that the rest of the world passed us in the fast lane if we do not keep challenging ourselves and the assumptions behind the practices and principles we use.
There will be a time where organizations are no longer battling “traditional waterfall/stage gate” to stay ahead but “traditional Agile”

**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**

Less religion and more openness to other fields of knowledge.
Less copying and more evolving new ideas and principles.
Maybe even the guts to challenge some parts of Agile :-)



**What do you see as the biggest challenge for software development today?**
Keeping it fun and motivating for everybody to go to work everyday - in a fast paced world where all companies are at risk of being disrupted and no-one can keep up with the amount of new tools and technologies.

**Whom do you think we should ask next?**

Lars Behn-Segall from Bankdata comes to mind.
He should be able to write some much cooler answers to the questions above.
