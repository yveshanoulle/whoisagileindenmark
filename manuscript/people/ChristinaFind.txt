**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**


I grew up as a kid with 5 half siblings who is 10-23 years younger than me, which have made me good at leading or guiding others, responsible, empathic and ensuring a good team spirit. It also taught me a lot about my own limits and that kids and teens are not always a good hormonal match.


**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I thought about being a psychologist or a doctor when growing up as the “PC” thing was not for me (I thought), but I ended up starting my career programming and configuring IT systems. I do think I would have become a good psychologist, but I also know that the excitement of not having the same problems to solve every day or the same issues to discuss all the times is some of the reasons why my worklife is fun. 



**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**


That I am 100% engaged personally in my customers and their challenges become mine. It makes me do my very best and ensuring that everybody does what is best for my customer and not what is best or easies for them. I sometimes forget that other people do not always feel the same way as I do, so I expect a lot from others as I do with myself.



**What drives you?**

Learning new things, meeting new people and solving challenges or problems. If my life consisted of operational and administrational work only, I would wither and die from boredom.



**What is your biggest achievement?**



Raising my 2 kids to become kind, polite, confident and selfless young people.	
Next up is being an independent consultant for 13 years and seeing how my influence at my customers really makes a difference for them.


**What is the last book you have read?**


Agile SAP & ADKAR




**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**



I would like the Agile community to become more collaborating with knowledge sharing, Jobs and personal development experiences. It is very local founded and a portal for scrum masters, agile coaches etc. would be a good place to offer your talent as well as finding jobs.

I also would like more IT departments to become Agile.

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

How do you differ from the rest?

I have tried a lot of different things in my career, from programming, implementing & configuring SAP, Process design, Architecture and project management to Change management, Agile Coaching, Scrum Master, Agile Transformation, training and testing besides being a department manager, so I know a lot about the dynamics of successful implementations and changing organizations.	

**What are you most proud of in your work?**



That I am fast in understanding a customer’s business and challenges and to decipher how to handle the situation. I’m quick to adapt to changes and a very openminded person with good listening skills and an opinion. I use my humor and openminded approach to engage with people and ensure that everyone thrives and thereby do their best as a team.

**Whom do you think we should ask next?**


Thomas Eilsø, who is already in the book :-)
