Since Yves asked me to be the editor for this book, I interpreted it an invitation to write about myself. 


**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

When I was 19 I worked at a psychiatric hospital in Stockholm. 
I travelled alone from Denmark after high school to work there and arrived in the middle of the night in a big dark park with a huge oldfashioned hospital. 
The taxa went away quickly and nobody opened the door. Luckily someone heard me shout and let me in. 
Nobody had been told I would arrive and noone knew where I should work or where I could sleep. 
So they placed me in a closed down part of the old, dark hospital, in an old closed ward, actually the one where Strindberg lived for parts of his life. 
The door only had a lock in the outside, the lights could only be turned on from the outside and there were bars on the window. 
I would not recommend it.
I got up in the morning and was told to change into my uniform and wash an old lady and change her diaper. 
It turned out it was meant as a test, since she was a somewhat violent lady. 
I managed to get it done in about an hour, only slightly bruised. 
I had never washed another person before, let alone someone I had just met, with whom I could not communicate (she spoke swedish and was too senile to understand my Danish).
The day went on like it has started and when I was done I decided that if I could do this, I could do anything. 
So something that was a very bad experience turned out to be the moment where I found out that I was strong for the first time in my life. 
Whenever things are difficult I think back at that day, where I felt so lost and useless and yet turned out to be useful. 


**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

I would have become some sort of teacher no matter which domain I had entered. 
That being said I have always been very interested in science in general and mathematics in particular. 
So I would most likely have become a school teacher in some science classes. 
Oh, and I have started dreaming about becoming a stand-up comedian, but sofar I can only make people in IT laugh. 
I think.

**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

I am very shy and insecure by nature. 
I have had to work with this every time I met new people or just initiating communication with someone who is not from my inner circle of friends and family. 
This challenge has forced me to learn how to communicate with people because it does not come naturally to me. 
I think I am using this in my teaching in order to explain subjects in different ways to different people. 
It is still a challenge every day and nowadays in a different way, since people sometimes interpret me as being arrogant or even scary, when the truth is that I am too scared to talk to them…..

**What drives you?**

Making people happy, either by enabling a learning process for them or by facilitating them to improve their ways of working. 
And making them laugh, but that is another story.

**What is your biggest achievement?**

I think finishing my ph.d. while experiencing a divorce, a move, the start of a new relationship, an added pregnancy must count as my biggest achievement when it comes to overcoming adversity. 
But my biggest legacy, and the one thing I have spent most time on in my life sofar, is my three children. 




**What is the last book you have read?**

I would choose to mention two: Simon Sinek: Leaders Eat Last. 
I like the stories and they come with some very good learnings. 
I like the rethinking from industry-age thinking with employees working like ants, to the current industry where we (should) aim to empower the employees. 
On the lighter side I have read Terry Pratchett: Pyramids. 
I love his books. 
I laugh out loud when I read them, which I do not often do when I am alone.
In particular I like the beginning when the prince train to become an assassin.

**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

What makes you happy?

Many things makes me happy, luckily. 
Workwise it is when people who initially are very much against retrospectives, or something I aim to teach them and then, after a while, they change and become my best ambassadors. 
I love that. 
Personally, being around my family, eating great food, drinking wonderful red wine or champagne, taking a long walk in beautiful nature. 
Laughing, always laughing .

**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**

Quite frankly I would like it to evolve so that there was no such word as “agile”; that it was the norm rather than something to even think about. 
Some companies work with agility intuitively, and looking at agile methodologies make them frustrated. 
Let us help each other be the best we can be and let agility be default.

**If you could get one wish granted about our software industry what would you wish for?**

That everybody was able to respect each other for what they are, what they can do and what they are prepared to do.

**Whom do you think we should ask next?**
