**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**
Most people don´t know that I am a published author. No, I haven´t written a bestselling novel or a book about some esoteric agile practice. I write short stories. It´s science fiction and it´s mainly very depressing stories about loss, death, revenge, post apocalyptic bleakness or deception and torture. Yay! Happy days! This surprises my – very few – readers because I´m a pretty easy going person who likes fun and games, love, music and pretty rainbows. :-)

It´s extremely rewarding for me to be evaluated by an editor and to be able to tell stories that are interesting enough to be published. It gives me a brain boost to be printed on dead wood and placed among other wonderful stories in digital and analog collections of words.



**If you would not be doing the job you are doing now, what would have become of you?**

1. Failed musician
2. Failed construction worker
3. Geology dropout
4. Annoying teacher with broken dreams (Please note: 1,2,3,5)
5. Failed author
6. Wildly successful salesman with a serious drug habit caused by self loathing



**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

I am capable of filtering out a lot of stuff in my brain. Unfortunately that causes me to sometimes forget some of the really important stuff and then I mess up. But generally I somehow get things done by some magic I have not fully understood. It´s a challenge for me, but I think it has kept me from ever having been stressed to a point where it would have been damaging for my health. The important things WILL get done. Take it easy about being perfect!

**What drives you?**

Curiosity and an urge to play, confuse, tinker and surprise. I love working with people be it as a coach, teacher, mentor, sparring partner or facilitator - as long as I make a difference.


**What is your biggest achievement?**

Raising my kids. Ongoing mission. Debriefing probably needed in ~12-15 years.

**What is the last book you have read?**

I reread “Hyperion” by Dan Simmons. And not for the last time.


**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

Why are so few people talking about the need for training people in understanding, using and practicing being creative in agile development? 

Well I plan to change that everywhere I go. In almost every event or activity in an agile framework (or life) you will benefit by knowing how to inspire horizontal thinking, associative thinking, having a ‘YES’ mindset, know how to play, know when to use divergent thinking and when not to. It will be more fun, more effective and much more motivating. You are born creative and spend so much time unlearning these skills as you grow up. That´s sad. Let´s do something about. :-)



**What do you see as the biggest challenge for software development today?**

Getting enough women onboard to save the world from the Man-Huumans.

**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**

As a community where employment by a specific company plays a minor part in sharing and learning together. I think this is already the case in some of the networking activities that I attend and I love the spirit. I would also like to see a much more positive attitude towards learning about the strengths and weaknesses of different scaling frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, DAD and so on.



**Whom do you think we should ask next?**

René Kragh Pedersen aka Relic, agile coach @ Bankdata
