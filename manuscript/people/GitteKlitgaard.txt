**What is something people usually don’t know about you but has influenced you in who you are?**

This is a hard question. Partly because so many things influenced me, partly because I have spoken and written publically about many things.
My experience is that people do not know that I am also fragile, vulnerable, and need someone to take care of me sometimes. I write about this in blogs and on twitter, I talk about it, and still people tell me that they don’t see it. 
They see a confident strong woman, who always helps and cares for others. And yes that is me. The fragile, vulnerable woman is also me.



**If you had not been in IT, what would have become of you? **

Good question :)
I started with studying economics and might have worked there.
If I did not do what I do know, I have always wanted to have a children’s bookstore. One that has a lot of quality books that was handpicked by me and my staff. It would only have staff that really loves books and sharing.
There would be a reading corner with soft cushions and chairs, where you can look in the books and there is a drawing table with crayons and colored pencils. One of the chairs would be a huge wing chair, and sometimes there would be someone with an amazing voice that would read out loud from the books :)




**What is your biggest challenge and why is it a good thing for you?**

To say no. There is so much I want to do and learn and see, and so many I want to help :)
I have learned to say no to things that I do not want to do, but I still struggle saying no to all the awesome things life offers me.

The good thing is that I get to do and see amazing things and places. I meet people from all over the world and learn and grow from that.
I mean: getting payed to travel to South Africa and speak about something I am passionate about. How cool is that? :)





**What drives you?**

Helping others. Helping them unleash their potential and see how much good stuff there is in them.
Also a bigger goal of making the world a better place: I so want people to be nice to each other; to talk in a good with; to talk with each other and not to each other; to truly listen and not just to answer; to respect and accept differences; maybe even appreciate the differences as it makes us bigger together.
I can do a little part of this by coaching and by helping companies function better.




**What is your biggest achievement?**

Letting go of what other people expect of me and becoming more and more who I am.
To become who I have always been. (Thanks to Alexey Krivitsky for that reframing).
It has been a long journey that is still not done.
When I met the German agile community and realised that I was not alone, that others wanted to make the world better, and that they liked me for who I was, that is when the journey began.
On my arm I have a tattoo with “Be brave “ to always remind me to have the courage to be myself.



**What is the last book you have read?**

“The Princess Bride” - loved it; loved the movie even more :)
For non-fiction it is “Calm” from “School of life”. It is an institute in England to help develop emotional intelligence. This book is about achieving calmness - something much needed in our busy lives.
 


**What question do you think I should also ask and what is the answer?**

What are you most proud of in your work?
I am most proud of helping people to see their worth, to see the light they have shining inside, but forgot about.
My goosebump moment was when a colleague said to me “You helped me go from being a nobody into being a somebody”.
We are all somebody - we just forget it sometimes and I help undoing that.



**How would you like the agile community in Denmark to evolve?**

I would like to see it be more active in collaboration with each other. It seems to me that the community is quite scattered and I find it hard to see what is happening. At the moment I am not sure it is a community - yet :)




**What do you see as the biggest challenge for software development today?**

That we still organize ourselves as if we live in the industrial age. We manage in that way and we expect people to work in that way. But we no longer produce goods; we produce ideas and thoughts and dreams.
It makes sense that the leader at a carpenter knows the craft of carpentry, but that is not the most important thing in software. There we need managers, who are leaders, who inspire people, who motivate people, who help them grow and become more independent in their work.





**Whom do you think we should ask next?**
