After the growing success of the global [“Who is agile?”](https://leanpub.com/WhoIsAgile) book, it has been decided to go for local country editions. This book is an example of such edition and is not the only one.





Already published local country versions, apart from this one:

* [“Who is agile in South Africa?”](https://leanpub.com/WhoisagileSouthAfrica) Local team: Samantha Laing and Karen Greaves.
* [“Who is agile in Australia & New Zealand?”](https://leanpub.com/whoisagileAustralia) Local team: Sunish Chabba, Venkatesh Krishnamurthy, and Renee Troughton.
* [“Who is agile in India”](https://leanpub.com/whoisagileinindia) Local team: Sunish Chabba and Tushar Somaiya.

There are also some number of other local country editions in the pipeline. Hopefully, they will be public soon.
